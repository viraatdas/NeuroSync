# NeuroTranslate: A Brain-Wave to Audio/Visual Model

The recent success of text-to-text LLM models and various modality-to-text models begs the question if we can achieve similar results with a complex input like brain-wave signals (such as EEG/fMRI) into audio and visual outputs. This project aims to explore the feasibility of such a model.

## Proposed Model
