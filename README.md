# NeuroSync

A supervised transformer to convert brain waves (EEG/fMRI) into video (what the person is seeing) and audio (what the person is hearing)

This is the main question we are trying to answer: 
1. Provided some calibration, to what degree can we recreate what the person is seeing and listening?

## TODOs
1. **Data Acquisition and Integration**
   - [ ] Establish protocols for collecting EEG/fMRI data.
   - [ ] Synchronize brain data with corresponding video and audio inputs.

2. **Data Processing**
   - [ ] Develop methods for EEG/fMRI data analysis.
   - [ ] Implement video and audio data processing techniques.

3. **Model Development**
   - [ ] Design and train a multimodal LM 
   - [ ] Integrate brain data processing with the LM
